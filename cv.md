#### About Myself:
My path began with admission to a technical college, where "Programming of local computer networks" was taught in the last courses. I graduated at the end of February and began to study the frontend in more depth, they offered a project on html + css, after I found out about this course and now I am writing about myself. 

The main field of activity at the moment is coffee and coffee drinks. About a year ago, in addition to studying, I worked as an administrator of quest rooms.

I believe that the motivation and interest in learning this field of activity will help me become an experienced Frontend developer.
